Build an application using React as if this application was a big and real world application: but only one
screen needs to be implemented
Assume there exists an API resource of users with properties: username, full_name
GET /api/users/ //returns you a list of users
GET /api/users/:username/ // returns you the user with that username
PUT /api/users/:username/ // updates the user with that username
Build a page which shows this list of users shows the properties
Also we should be able to update Full Name of the user.
Don’t forget to handle exceptions.
You can have a mock server, assume the API is there and returns you the desired objects.
Optional (would be good if implemented)
Additional properties for users status (online/offline), last_seen_at (a timestamp) needs to be supported by
websockets, when a user goes offline the change should reflect on the front end immediately without
refreshing the page (also color the status in green if online and in red if offline)

✔ fetch all users @done(18-05-21 08:36)
✔ show list of users, properties @done(18-05-21 08:36)
✔ update user's fullname @done(18-05-21 09:41)
✔ ability to update full_name @done(18-05-21 09:41)

- handle exceptions
- optional: add online/offline, last_seen_at props; with websockets
  - green if online, red otherwise
- add spinner
- add testing
  - jest
- add design and stylization
  - material ui
